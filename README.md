This webpage was created to help myself get familiar with HTML and CSS. Some of the key features the webpage includes are widgets that can toggle between open and closed to display text, a progress bar, a feedback form that makes a POST request to a web resource link, and an automatic email link in the footer with pre-written data for the recipient, subject, and body. CSS was used to create a responsive two-column layout using Flexbox where the right side is dedicated to an embedded YouTube video.
